CheckVersions is a powerful and intuitive version comparison tool designed to simplify the process of discerning the latest and older versions in software development.

## Features

- **Semantic Version Analysis:** üßê Leverage our sophisticated semantic versioning analysis engine to compare versions like "0.0.0-beta" effortlessly.

- **Automated Version Ranking:** üöÄ CheckVersions automatically ranks versions based on their priority, allowing you to quickly identify the latest version.

- **Efficient Version Delta Assessment:** üìä CheckVersions provides a simple and efficient way to assess the difference between two versions.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** üé® Our intuitive user interface ensures that developers can effortlessly compare versions.

- **Secure Version Analysis:** üîí Security is paramount. CheckVersions ensures version comparison is performed securely, protecting your intellectual property and facilitating risk-free decision-making in your development process.

- **Custom Hierarchy** üìù Customize the hierarchy of version words to suit your needs. For instance, you can assign a higher priority to "beta" than "alpha" if you wish.

- **Older Version Retrieval:** ‚è≥ Optionally retrieve the older version when comparing two versions by setting the `older_version` parameter to `True`.

## Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
npm install checkversions
```
## Usage
```python3
from checkversions import *

# Example 1: Basic Version Comparison
current_version = "v1.0.0"
latest_version = "v1.0.0-beta"
result = compare_versions(current_version, latest_version)
print(result)
# Output: v1.0.0
```
In this example, we demonstrate a basic version comparison. The compare_versions function is used to compare the current_version (v1.0.0) with the latest_version (v1.0.0-beta). The result is printed, and it shows that the latest version is v1.0.0.

```python3
from checkversions import *

# Example 2: Comparing Versions with Hyphens and Words
version1 = "2.0.0-beta"
version2 = "2.0.1-alpha"
result = compare_versions(version1, version2)
print(result)
# Output: 2.0.1-alpha

```
In this example, we showcase version comparison with hyphens and additional words. The compare_versions function compares version1 (2.0.0-beta) with version2 (2.0.1-alpha). The result is printed, indicating that the latest version is 2.0.1-alpha.

## Default Hierarchy
```json
{
  "beta": 0,
  "prerelease": 1,
  "alpha": 2,
  "unstable": 3,
  "stable": 4,
  "release": 5
}

```
The default hierarchy is a JSON representation that assigns priority values to version words. For instance, "beta" has a priority of 0, "prerelease" has a priority of 1, and so on.

## Custom Hierarchy

```python3
from checkversions import *

# Example 3: Custom Hierarchy
# Define a custom hierarchy
custom_hierarchy = {"beta": 0, "alpha": 1, "rc": 2, "gamma": 3, "stable": 4}

version1 = "v1.0.0-beta"
version2 = "v1.0.1-alpha"
result = compare_versions(version1, version2, custom_hierarchy)
print(result)
# Output: v1.0.1-alpha

```
In this example, we introduce a custom hierarchy for version comparison. The custom_hierarchy dictionary is defined with version words and their corresponding priority. The compare_versions function uses this custom hierarchy to compare version1 (v1.0.0-beta) with version2 (v1.0.1-alpha). The result is printed, indicating that the latest version is v1.0.1-alpha.

## Older Version

```python3
from checkversions import *
current_version = "v1.0.0"
latest_version = "v1.0.0-beta"
# Example with older_version=True
result_older = compare_versions(current_version, latest_version, older_version=True)
print(f"Older version: {result_older}")
# Output: Older version: v1.0.0-beta
```
In this example, by setting older_version=True, the function returns and prints the older version (v1.0.0-beta) based on the provided versions (v1.0.0 and v1.0.0-beta). If older_version is omitted or set to False, it would return and print the latest version.
